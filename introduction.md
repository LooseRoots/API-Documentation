# Introduction

API access is over HTTPS and avaliable from api.create.net. Our API supports JSON and XML formats. Authentication is handled with OAuth2

The standard four HTTP verbs are used to access our resources:

*GET* - Use when requesting an existing resource

*POST* - Use when creating a new resource

*PUT* - Use when updating an existing resource

*DELETE* - Use when deleting a resource

## About Request and Response Formats

Requests and responses can be provided in either JSON or XML. Set the HTTP Accept header to specify the response format and the HTTP Content-Type header to specify the request format.
